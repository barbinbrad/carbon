# Carbon ERP

<Features />

Carbon ERP is a high permformance, [open-source](https://github.com/barbinbrad/carbon), single-tenant (incomplete) ERP. It allows customers, suppliers, and employees to share a common platform.

## Why Carbon ERP?

We built Carbon ERP because we wanted a real solution to manufacturing scheduling. But in order to solve this problem, we needed to build a complete ERP (and more).

Currently you shouldn't use Carbon ERP for your business. It is incomplete and not ready for the big time. However, it is currently a great learning tool for those who want to learn about business software. It is also a great opportunity for anyone who wants to make better business software with the [latest technologies](../develop/tech-stack).

By the time it's ready for production, it will have stable support the following modules:

- [x] Accounting
- [x] Inventory
- [x] Purchasing
- [x] Sales
- [x] Manufacturing
- [x] Resources Management
- [x] Timecards
- [x] Bill of Material and Routing Configuration
- [x] Supplier Accounts
- [x] Customer Accounts

We'll then be able to focus on the original goal of scheduling and planning.

## What about other open-source ERPs?

One major difference between Carbon and other open-source ERPs is the license. ERPs like [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) and [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/) are licensed under the "copyleft" GPL-family of licenses. This means that if you use the software, you must also open-source your software. This is a great license for open-source software vendors, but it's not a great license for business software.
